# AnkiReColourMenuFix
An enhancement for the Anki ReColor add-on menu code which:
- Removes the extraneous AnKing menu along with the links inside it
- Renames `ReColor` to `ReColour`
- Moves `ReColour` to the `Tools` menu

# Directions
1. From the Anki add-ons menu (accessed with Ctrl+Shift+A), select the `ReColor` add-on.
2. Click `View Files` in the bottom-right corner.
3. In the file browser window which appears, replace the `menu.py` file with the one from this repository.
4. Restart Anki.

You may have to repeat these steps after an official update overwrites the file.
